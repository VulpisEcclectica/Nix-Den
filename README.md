# Nix-Den (hehe den because fox)

About how I said I was going to read the thesis first (she says as if its likely anyone's seen this)... well, I did not :( 
Though I am working through it - I realised that I kinda need a working neovim/LaTeX config for some work stuff so good? news
Also, though no one cares I have had the ultimate betrayal!! (Hyphanet paper I was reading was the wrong version so of course ended up wasting some time being annoyed about it)
